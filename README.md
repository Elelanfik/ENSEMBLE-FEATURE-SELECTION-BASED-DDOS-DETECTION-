# ENSEMBLE-FEATURE-SELECTION-BASED-DDOS-DETECTION-
 This work proposes a new framework for App-DDoS detection using ensemble feature selection and ML/DL models. The framework achieves high accuracy (99%+), significant feature reduction (74%+), and low computational time (0.15+ minutes), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.
